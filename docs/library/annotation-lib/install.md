### About versions

**The latest version is always recommended.** If you need a previous version, see recent files on CurseForge / Modrinth / Maven Repos.

You may see a lot of versions in `https://maven.iafenvoy.com/#/releases/com/iafenvoy/annotationlib` which is not available on both CurseForge and Modrinth. This means this version is not stable and has critical bugs. **Do not use them!**
